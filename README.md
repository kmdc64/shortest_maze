# Shortest Route
A program that can take in a text file with a maze consisting of different characters representing a key, and find the shortest route (or inform the user that there is no route to take). This was an exercise in learning how to read & process files and implementing BFS.

The available options are:
* bad_maze
* bad_maze_2
* quickest_route_1
* quickest_route_2
* quickest_route_3
* quickest_route_4
* quickest_route_5
* quickest_route_6

More can be added by creating your own maze .txt file and adding it to the "Mazes" folder.

It does not currently handle entering a name of a non-existent file.
